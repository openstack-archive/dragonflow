Overview
--------

Dragonflow implements Neutron using a lightweight embedded SDN Controller.

Our project mission is *to Implement advanced networking services in a manner
that is efficient, elegant and resource-nimble*

Distributed Dragonflow
======================

Comprehensive agentless implementation of the Neutron APIs and advanced
network services, such as fully distributed Switching, Routing, DHCP
and more.

This configuration is the current focus of Dragonflow.
Overview and details are available in the `Distributed Dragonflow Section`_

Configurations
==============

To generate the sample dragonflow configuration files, run the following
command from the top level of the dragonflow directory:

tox -e genconfig

If a 'tox' environment is unavailable, then you can run the following script
instead to generate the configuration files:

./tools/generate_config_file_samples.sh
