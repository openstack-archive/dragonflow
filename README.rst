Overview
--------

Dragonflow implements Neutron using a lightweight embedded SDN Controller.

Dragonflow is available in two configurations: Distributed and Centralized.

Our project mission is *to Implement advanced networking services in a manner
that is efficient, elegant and resource-nimble*

Distributed Dragonflow
======================

Comprehensive agentless implementation of the Neutron APIs and advanced
network services, such as fully distributed Switching, Routing, DHCP
and more.

This configuration is the current focus of Dragonflow.
Overview and details are available in the `Distributed Dragonflow Section`_
