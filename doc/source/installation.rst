============
Installation
============

``git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack``

Copy one of the following as your local.conf to your devstack folder


- `DevStack Single Node Configuration <https://github.com/openstack/dragonflow/tree/master/doc/source/single-node-conf>`_

- `DevStack Multi Node Configuration <https://github.com/openstack/dragonflow/tree/master/doc/source/multi-node-conf>`_

  Run ./stack.sh

  Once the script has finished successfully, Dragonflow is
  ready to move packets.  You can see `Testing and Debugging
  <testing_and_debugging.rst>`_ to test and troubleshoot the deployment.

=============================
Automated setup using Vagrant
=============================

This will create a 3 node devstack (controller + two computes), where Dragonflow is used as
the Open vSwitch backend.

Vagrant allows to configure the provider on which the virtual machines are
created. Virtualbox is the default provider used to launch the VM's on a
developer computer, but other providers can be used: libvirt, VMWare, AWS, OpenStack,
containers stuff, ...

Quick Start
-----------

1. Install a Hypervisor if not already installed

   1.1. For Virtualbox - https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

   1.2. For libvirt - use you Linux distribution manuals

2. Install Vagrant - https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

3. Configure

::

    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/dragonflow
    cd dragonflow
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

4. | For full install with a controller node and 2 compute nodes follow step 4.1;
   | For a minimal install with All-In-One setup, follow step 4.2

   4.1. Adjust the settings in `vagrant/provisioning/dragonflow.conf.yml` if
        needed (5GB RAM is the minimum to get 1 VM running on the controller
        node)

        * Launch the VM's: `vagrant up`

        * This may take a while, once it is finished:

          * You can ssh into the virtual machines:
            `vagrant ssh devstack_controller`, `vagrant ssh devstack_compute1`
            or `vagrant ssh devstack_compute2`

          * You can access the horizon dashboard at
            http://controller.devstack.dev

          * The dragonflow folder is shared between the host and the two nodes
            (at /home/vagrant/dragonflow)

        * When you are done with the setup, you can remove the VMs:
          `vagrant destroy`

   4.2. Adjust the settings in `vagrant/provisioning/dragonflow.conf.yml` if
        needed

        * Launch the VM: `vagrant up devstack_aio`

        * This may take a while, once it is finished:

          * You can ssh into the virtual machine: `vagrant ssh devstack_aio`

          * You can access the horizon dashboard at
            http://allinone.devstack.dev

          * The dragonflow folder is shared between the host and the VM (at
            /home/vagrant/dragonflow)

        * When you are done with the setup, you can remove the VM:
          `vagrant destroy devstack_aio`
