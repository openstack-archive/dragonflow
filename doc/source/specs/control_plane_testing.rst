Dragonflow control plane test
=============================

This test plan consists of the following sections:
1. NoSQL Database Test Plan
2. Message Publish Subscribe Test Plan
3. Neutron Objects Set-Up Time
4. Stress Tests


1. NoSQL Database Test Plan
===========================

Dragonflow can work with a number of NoSQL databases.
Each one has it's own advantages and disadvantages.

Dragonflow supports the following key/value databases:

1. Etcd
2. Redis
3. Ramcloud
4. Zookeeper

Some of the databases above support clustering. We will perform tests against
database server configured in single and multiple node.

The system will be tested against the following configuration:

1. All in one server together with NoSQL server
2. Two or more servers required to enable NoSQL clustering configuration.

Some of the results will be compared with MySQL.

First test: random access test scenario
=======================================

The test will create 1000 database objects and performs random access test.
The test will be performed againstt all supported databases and compared with MySQL.
This tests will mimic the case when Dragonflow received a notification when an
object is created and it needs to load object records from the database.

1. Preparation
--------------
The script will create 1000 database objects like routers.

TODO: Create a script here

2. Random access script
-----------------------
The test will fetch a list of all objects from the database and fetch object in
random way. The script will be tested against all supported databases.

TODO: create a script here

3. Record DB process activity
-----------------------------

TODO: Create a script that records db process activity

3. Generate report
------------------

Generate comparison table.


2. Message Publish Subscribe Test Plan
==========================
Message publish/subscribe test plan is intended to test Dragonflow PUB/SUB mechanizm.
This test measures the aggregate throughput of a MQ layer.
Currently Dragonflow support only ZeroMQ messaging system.

TODO: This test will be done when we will have more than one supported PUB/SUB method.
For now, as an alternative, the set-up time test will cover the whole time for object
creation including time to distribute messages for now.


3. Neutron Objects Set-Up Time
==============================

The idea in this test is to measure time for the whole object creation: from calling
Neutron API until OpenFlows rules are changed. In new Dragonflow architecture the
object creation is propagated using the following manner:

1. Neutron receives an API call to create an object (network, subnet, port, etc...)
2. Neutron fires Dragonflow plugin with just created object
3. Dragonflow plugin saves a new record to NoSQL db
4. Dragonflow sends a message with the new object id using the ZeroMQ message
5. Neutron controller receives a message from ZeroMQ with an object id
6. Neutron controller fetches full object records from NoSQL db
7. Neutron controller, if required, creates new nessesary OpenFlow rules.

Now a new object is basically transfered to the actuall OpenFlow rules.

This test will measure time required to perform the whole operation.
In addition to calculating of time requiered to perform one object creation,
we will calculate time for simultaneous creation of multiple objects.

We will calculate time to create multiple objects as listed in the following table:

1. 1 object created
2. 5 objects created
3. 10 objects created
4. 20 objects created
5. 50 objects created
6. 100 objects created
7. 200 objects created

It is important to see that the time required to add new object is growing
linearly.

The results should be saved.

Now we will be able to perfom regression tests and compare results with
new and old Dragonflow versions. In addition, we can run similar tests
against the Neutron OVN deployment and compare results with the Neutron
Dragonflow deployment.


4. Stress Tests
===============
AWS network related limitations that may check with Dragonflow at Openstack:

Subnets per VPC: 200
A segment of a VPCâ€™s IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources.

Internet gateways per region: 5
The Amazon VPC side of a connection to the public Internet.

NAT gateways per Availability Zone: 5
A highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service for your resources in a private subnet to access the internet.

Network ACLs per VPC : 200
You can associate one network ACL to one or more subnets in a VPC

Rules per network ACL: 20
This is the one-way limit for a single network ACL, where the limit for ingress rules is 20, and the limit for egress rules is 20. This limit can be increased upon request up to a maximum if 40; however, network performance may be impacted due to the increased workload to process the additional rules.

Network interfaces per VPC: 100
This limit is calculated by multiplying your On-Demand instance limit by 5. The default limit for On-Demand instances is 20. You can increase the number of network interfaces per VPC by contacting AWS Support, or by increasing your On-Demand instance limit.

Route tables per VPC: 200
Including the main route table. You can associate one route table to one or more subnets in a VPC.

Routes per route table (non-propagated routes): 50
This is the limit for the number of non-propagated entries per route table. Maximum of 100; however, network performance may be impacted. 

BGP advertised routes per route table (propagated routes): 100
You can have up to 100 propagated routes per route table; however, the total number of propagated and non-propagated entries per route table cannot exceed 100. For example, if you have 50 non-propagated entries (the default limit for this type of entry), you can only have 50 propagated entries. This limit cannot be increased. If you require more than 100 prefixes, advertise a default route.

Inbound or outbound rules per security group:50
Security groups per network interface: 5
The multiple of the limit for rules per security group and the limit for security groups per network interface cannot exceed 250.

VPC endpoints per region: 20
Maximum of 255 endpoints per VPC.



Transcript from emails:
There is also a control plane performance issue when we try to catch on the spec of typical AWS limit (200 subnets per router). When a router with 200 subnets is scheduled on a new host, a 30s delay is watched when all data plane setup is finished.

More to address:
Create max Subnet on a router or for a tenant test create 1000 SG etc
