    Added support for the OSProfiler.
    OSProfiler provides a tiny but powerful library that is used by
    most (soon to be all) OpenStack projects and their python clients. It
    provides functionality to be able to generate one trace per request, that
    goes through all involved services. This trace can then be extracted and
    used to build a tree of calls which can be quite handy for a variety of
    reasons (for example in isolating cross-project performance issues).
    The OSProfiler is off by default, extra configuration is required to
    enable it. Please refer to the documentation for further details.
