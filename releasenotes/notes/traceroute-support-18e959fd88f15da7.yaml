    Traceroute support.
features:
  - As a Openflow based SDN, traceroute and its back-end network
    functionalities are not naturally supported. Dragonflow supports traceroute
    base on RFC792, RFC4884, RFC1812 and RFC5508. Traceroute in Dragonflow
    cluster works for virtual router and NAT device.
security:
  - To prevent DDoS, the rate of responding ICMP error message is controlled by
    several configuration options. They are 'dnat_ttl_invalid_max_rate',
    'dnat_icmp_error_max_rate', 'router_ttl_invalid_max_rate' and
    'router_port_unreach_max_rate'.
